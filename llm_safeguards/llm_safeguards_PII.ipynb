    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to illustrate how to monitor PII data leakage in Generative AI. It is of paramount importance to safeguard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data'>Personally Identifiable Information</a> while prompt injection techniques are evolving at a rapid pace. Intervention for PII data leak should proactive and not reactive as this kind of information has much higher impact on safety, trust and revenue of an organization. This notebook showcases how to identify if the response from an LLM contains PII information and how to intervene before the information reaches the end user.<br> <br>"
